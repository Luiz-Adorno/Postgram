# Postgrm
It was an interesting project to do, I had about 8 hours to carry out (2 days, 4 hours each day) this solution, where I managed to do everything that was asked for on the screens. I didn't have the time to implement Pagination to capture 10 items on each request.

I used MVVM architecture. MVVM cleanly separates the user interface from the application logic, divorcing one from the other improves application maintenance. It also makes application evolution easier, thereby reducing the risk of technological obsolescence. Eliminates the need for application redesign and has the benefits of easier testing and modularit.

If I had time I would improve the UI and make more robust unit tests.
